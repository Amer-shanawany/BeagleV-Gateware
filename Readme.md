# B-V-F

## Description

This repository can be used to generate a reference design for the B-V-F. This reference design will have the same or extended functionality compared to the pre-programmed FPGA design on the B-V-F.

A Libero SoC Tcl script is provided to generate the reference design using Libero SoC along with device specific I/O constraints.

This repository supports Libero SoC v2021.2, which is available for download [here](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc#downloads).

## Using the reference design generation Tcl script

#### Standard design generation

To generate the standard reference design which is capable of running the majority of bare metal example applications and run Linux&reg; the following flow can be used:

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open Libero v2021.2
3. Open the execute script dialog (CTRL + U)
4. Execute the "B_V_F_REFERENCE_DESIGN.tcl" script
5. Configure the design if required
6. Run the Libero SoC design flow to program a device
